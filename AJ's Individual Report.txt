For this project, we all worked as a team on the queries. We utilized the pair programming approach so that we can catch each other's mistakes before we go further. I made Docker containers for both mysql and postgres instances. I mainly worked on the Postgres queries. One of the obstacles was figuring out how postgres variables work. After I wrote them, I ported them to mysql with Peter. Then, James and Peter worked on the optimized versions. Using James' seed data into a sqldump file, I was able to recreated the same randomized database in the Docker instances' databases.
